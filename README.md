In this Pricing Page project, the objective is to demonstrate your skills in HTML and CSS by creating
a visually appealing and user-friendly pricing page for a fictional product or service. The project
includes building the page's structure and style using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive design
that adapts to different screen sizes, and optionally incorporating JavaScript for dynamic elements
such as interactive pricing toggles or hover effects. This hands-on experience will not only
strengthen your fundamental web development skills but also provide you with the opportunity to
showcase your creativity in designing a practical and engaging pricing interface.
